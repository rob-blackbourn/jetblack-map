# Map

A map component for React.

This is work in progress!

## Overview

This package provides a tiled map component with support for interaction and markers.

The component has a few unique features:

* Is is built as a pure react component with no dependencies,
* When zoomed out the map can scroll continuously in the horizontal direction.
* It uses hooks to provide interaction with the map.

## Demo

<DemoMap />

## Acknowledgements

This is largely a reworking of other libraries.

In particular much of the heavy lifting was done by [Pigeon Maps](https://github.com/mariusandra/pigeon-maps).

Another library which was a good source of ideas was [react-slippy-map](https://github.com/gaswelder/react-slippy-map).

## What Next ?
