# Release 0.1.0-alpha.12

This release made some changes to the tile providers.

The `dprs` property was removed, as I decided to follow the leaflet strategy of
checking the resolution of the browser.

I removed the MapTiler tile provider, as they appear to have significantly
different url construction. I have added a story which demonstrates how to
use different MapTiler tiles.

Some more documentation on the components was added.
