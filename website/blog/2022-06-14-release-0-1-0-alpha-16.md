# Release 0.1.0-alpha.16

More breaking changes.

I finally got round to documenting the hooks. As I often find with attempting
to explain something, the process reveals things that need improvement.

This ended in me renaming the interaction hooks to: `useDrag`, `useZoom`, and
`useClick`, which I find more obvious.

I think the next step is to come out of alpha versions and make a major release.
